We've ordered the same cable from two different sources: KVH and Digi-Key. The former is a [MIL-DTL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Military_Standard) cable that costs $485. The latter is a generic $29 cable.

The KVH cable does display higher build quality compared to the Digi-Key cable, though they probably aren't worth the cost right now (we aren't putting human lives on the line with ATRIAS yet).

The KVH cable:

  * Has slightly thicker (maybe 2 AWG's worth) inner conductors
  * Has a hermetic seal around the pins
  * Assigns RX/TX differential pairs to twisted conductor pairs (at 1 Mbaud UART, this probably is not a big deal, but it should help)
  * Generally fits the IMU better (<font color='red'>the Digi-Key cable has cylindrical extrusions around the mating screws that must be sawed off</font>)

## Assembly ##
Both cables have 15 conductors, but they do NOT share the same color code
mapping. Refer to <a href='http://media.digikey.com/pdf/Data%20Sheets/Norcomp%20PDFs/CCA-015-YYYR152.pdf'>this datasheet (PDF)</a>
for the Digi-Key cable.

The color mapping is as follows:

| **Pin #** | **KVH cable** | **Digi-Key cable** |
|:----------|:--------------|:-------------------|
|  1 | WHITE/BROWN  | BLACK       |
|  2 | WHITE/BLACK  | BROWN       |
|  3 | WHITE/ORANGE | RED         |
|  4 | WHITE/YELLOW | ORANGE      |
|  5 | BLACK        | YELLOW      |
|  6 | BROWN        | GREEN       |
|  7 | RED          | BLUE        |
|  8 | ORANGE       | VIOLET      |
|  9 | GRAY         | GRAY        |
| 10 | WHITE        | WHITE       |
| 11 | YELLOW       | PINK        |
| 12 | WHITE/GREEN  | LIGHT GREEN |
| 13 | BLUE         | WHITE/BLACK |
| 14 | VIOLET       | WHITE/BROWN |
| 15 | GREEN        | WHITE/RED   |

## Double check! ##
Double check your cable with a multimeter. The following is a (slightly
modified) diagram of the IMU interface connector from the technical manual.
Obviously, the cable pinout is a vertical reflection of this.
